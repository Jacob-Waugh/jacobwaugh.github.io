      <p>It was made and presented with a group for the capstone assignment at Wake Tech, an 8 week game jame. The theme for that year was "Abandonware".</p>
      <p>My group and I did a lot on this project. I had to wear many hats, working on design documentation, player modeling and animations, and designing and scripting gameplay, level, and UI/UX systems using Blueprint</p>
      <p>A list of my main contributions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Helping plan the intended path through the office and Genesis (the in-game VR world)</li>
          <li>Planning, whiteboxing, and level scripting for Genesis</li>
          <li>Modeling, rigging, animating, and scripting the player model</li>
          <li>Interactable highlight system and visual</li>
          <li>Objective UI popup system and visual</li>
          <li>Office and Genesis note systems</li>
          <li>Handwritten typeface for notes</li>
          <li>Playtesting and bug write-ups</li>
        </ul>
      <p>This project taught me a lot, and gave me a lot of experience working with a team on a game from start to finish. </p>
