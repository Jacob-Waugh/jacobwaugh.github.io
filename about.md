    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <h3>I was born and raised in Chapel Hill, NC, and grew up playing all kinds of games.</h3>
    <p>I find that I'm naturally curious in how games work, and am constantly thinking about the behind-the-scenes
      aspects.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>I graduated from Wake Tech with an AAS in Simulation & Game Development in 2025.</h3>
    <p>While attending, I learned
      about many different aspects and disiplines involved in the industry, and gained lots of experience working with
      others on various projects. </p>
