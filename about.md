<div class="about">
  <h3>Hello!</h3>
  <h4>I was born and raised in Chapel Hill, NC, and grew up playing all kinds of games.</h4>
  <p>I find that I'm naturally curious in how games work, and am constantly thinking about the behind-the-scenes
    aspects.</p>
  <hr>
  <h4>I graduated from Wake Tech with an AAS in Simulation & Game Development in 2025.</h4>
  <p>While attending, I learned
    about many different aspects and disiplines involved in the industry, and gained lots of experience working with
    others on various projects. </p>
